# Help me diet, The Game

> A JavaScript game. Play directly in browser.

Our friend Uki wants to eat according to his diet and he needs your help, because he likes pizza too much. Help him by serving only healthy food!

In this game, you mission is to open covers on all the plates without running into pizza, which is on only one plate. 
If you reveal all of healthy food and pizza is the last one you reveal, you win, because Uki will be too full to eat more.
But if the pizaa is on the plate right away or on the second plate, you will lose, because Uki will have no choice than to eat what's on the plate.
Have fun and good luck!

When you open the game for the first time, you just start opening the covers on plates, and to try again or restart press the button beneath (It will tell you if you won or lost).
